# Attendence-tracker
The Attendance Tracker is a simple React component designed to help faculty members and educators easily track student attendance in real time. The user interface displays a list of students, each with a checkbox to mark them as “Present.” The component uses React’s useState hook to manage attendance status and dynamically updates.
